Coming to Australia
Before you travel
Once you have been granted your Work and Holiday Visa you do not need to apply for another visa, such as an eVisitor (subclass 651) visa, to enter Australia.

If you apply for and are granted another visa (such as subclass 651 visa) after the grant of your Work and Holiday visa, your first Work and Holiday visa (and related work rights) will cease on the date that visa is granted. 

If your first Work and Holiday visa ceased due to the grant of another visa, such as an eVisitor visa, and you entered Australia on that other visa, you will not be able to apply for another first Work and Holiday visa while you are in Australia. 

Check your travel documents are up to date.

Your Work and Holiday visa will be linked to the passport you declared on your application. If you obtain a new passport after your visa is granted, you must tell us your new passport details. See how to tell us if your situation changes. 
If you do not update your passport details, you will face delays at your overseas departure point and may not be permitted to board your flight. 
You must have:

a Work and Holiday visa that is in effect to enter Australia - you do not need a separate visa to enter Australia (the Department recommends that you keep a copy of your grant letter (electronic or paper) while travelling)
a valid passport or other travel document
If you also hold another visa
It is important that you only apply for a Work and Holiday visa once you are ready to enter Australia on that visa.

Once we grant your Work and Holiday visa and you travel to Australia and are immigration cleared at the border, the 12-month visa period of stay will automatically start upon entry, regardless of the purpose of your visit.

The Work and Holiday visa period of stay will commence even if you are transiting through Australia on your way to another country, and if you hold one of the following temporary visas at the same time as you hold your Work and Holiday visa:

Special Purpose visa (for example, airline crew members who have been registered for a Crew Travel Authority (CTA) or transit passengers from certain countries)
Electronic Travel Authority (subclass 601)
Maritime Crew visa (subclass 988)
Transit visa (subclass 771)
If you applied for a COVID-19 Pandemic event (subclass 408) visa

If you hold a Work and Holiday visa and have an undecided COVID-19 Pandemic event visa application, but you no longer wish to be granted this visa, you must withdraw your application as soon as possible. If your COVID-19 Pandemic event visa is granted, it will replace your Work and Holiday visa.

You can withdraw your application by submitting Form 1446 Withdrawal of a visa application via ImmiAccount.

All people arriving in Australia must complete the  Incoming Passenger Card. You will be given this card onboard.

Coming to Australia
Before you travel
Once you have been granted your Work and Holiday Visa offshore you do not need to apply for another visa, such as an eVisitor (subclass 651) visa, to enter Australia.

If you apply for and are granted another visa (such as subclass 651 visa) after the grant of your second Work and Holiday visa, your Work and Holiday visa (and related work rights) will cease on the date that visa is granted.

If your second Work and Holiday visa ceased due to the grant of another visa, such as an eVisitor visa, and you entered Australia on that other visa, you may be able to apply for another second Work and Holiday visa while you are in Australia. You will need to pay the Visa Application Charge (VAC) if you apply again. 

Check your travel documents are up to date
Your Work and Holiday visa will be linked to the passport you declared on your application. If you obtain a new passport after your visa is granted, you must tell us your new passport details. See how to tell us if your situation changes.
If you do not update your passport details, you will face delays at your overseas departure point and may not be permitted to board your flight
You must have:
a Work and Holiday visa that is in effect to enter Australia - you do not need a separate visa to enter Australia (the Department recommends that you keep a copy of your grant letter (electronic or paper) while travelling)
a valid passport or other travel document
If you also hold another visa
It is important that you only apply for a Work and Holiday visa once you are ready to enter Australia on that visa. Once we grant your Work and Holiday visa and you travel to Australia and are immigration cleared at the border, the 12-month visa period of stay will automatically start upon entry, regardless of the purpose of your visit.

The Work and Holiday visa period of stay will commence even if you are transiting through Australia on your way to another country, and if you hold one of the following temporary visas at the same time as you hold a Work and Holiday visa:

Special Purpose visa (for example, airline crew members who have been registered for a Crew Travel Authority (CTA) or transit passengers from certain countries)
Electronic Travel Authority (subclass 601)
Maritime Crew visa (subclass 988)
Transit visa (subclass 771)
If you applied for a COVID-19 Pandemic event (subclass 408) visa
If you hold a Work and Holiday visa and have an undecided COVID-19 Pandemic event visa application, but you no longer wish to be granted this visa, you must withdraw your application as soon as possible. If your COVID-19 Pandemic event visa is granted, it will replace your Work and Holiday visa.

You can withdraw your application by submitting Form 1446 Withdrawal of a visa application via ImmiAccount.

Step 4

After you apply
See what you can and must do after you apply.

We will let you know when we have received your application.

Step 5

Visa outcome
We will let you know our decision in writing.

If we grant your visa, we will tell you:

your visa grant number
the date your visa starts
your visa conditions
Keep a copy of the decision notification with you when in Australia.

If we refuse your visa, we will tell you:

why we refused the visa
if you have a right to a review of the decision
Coming to Australia
Before you travel
Once you have been granted your third Work and Holiday Visa offshore you do not need to apply for another visa, such as an eVisitor (subclass 651) visa, to enter Australia.

If you apply for and are granted another visa (such as subclass 651 visa) after the grant of your third Work and Holiday visa, your Work and Holiday visa (and related work rights) will cease on the date that visa is granted.

If your third Work and Holiday visa ceased due to the grant of another visa, such as an eVisitor visa, and you entered Australia on that other visa, you may be able to apply for another third Work and Holiday visa while you are in Australia. You will need to pay the Visa Application Charge (VAC) if you apply again. 

Check your travel documents are up to date
Your Work and Holiday visa will be linked to the passport you declared on your application. If you obtain a new passport after your visa is granted, you must tell us your new passport details. See how to tell us if your situation changes.
If you do not update your passport details, you will face delays at your overseas departure point and may not be permitted to board your flight
You must have:
a Work and Holiday visa that is in effect to enter Australia - you do not need a separate visa to enter Australia (the Department recommends that you keep a copy of your grant letter (electronic or paper) while travelling)
a valid passport or other travel document
If you also hold another visa
It is important that you only apply for a Work and Holiday visa once you are ready to enter Australia on that visa. Once we grant your Work and Holiday visa and you travel to Australia and are immigration cleared at the border, the 12-month visa period of stay will automatically start upon entry, regardless of the purpose of your visit.

The Work and Holiday visa period of stay will commence even if you are transiting through Australia on your way to another country, and if you hold one of the following temporary visas at the same time as you hold your Work and Holiday visa:

Special Purpose visa (for example, airline crew members who have been registered for a Crew Travel Authority (CTA) or transit passengers from certain countries)
Electronic Travel Authority (subclass 601)
Maritime Crew visa (subclass 988)
Transit visa (subclass 771)
If you applied for a COVID-19 Pandemic event (subclass 408) visa
If you hold a Work and Holiday visa and have an undecided COVID-19 Pandemic event visa application, but you no longer wish to be granted this visa, you must withdraw your application as soon as possible. If your COVID-19 Pandemic event visa is granted, it will replace your Work and Holiday visa.

You can withdraw your application by submitting Form 1446 Withdrawal of a visa application via ImmiAccount.

At the border
Completing an Incoming Passenger Card

All people arriving in Australia must complete the Incoming Passenger Card. You will be given this card onboard.

Working Holiday Maker (WHM) program
Australia's reciprocal Working Holiday Maker (WHM) program has been fostering stronger links between young people from Australia and around the world since 1975.   
It allows young adults to have a 12 month holiday, during which they can undertake short-term work and study. 
The WHM program now includes over 40 partner countries or jurisdictions in two visa subclasses, the Working Holiday (subclass 417) visa and the Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa. 
Status of country caps
​​
​​There is an annual limit or 'cap' on the number of first Work and Holiday (subclass 462) ​visas available in each program year (1 July to 30 June) for applicants who hold a passport from the countries in the following table. Once the cap has been filled, no more applications can be lodged until the next program year. There is no cap on second or third Work and Holiday visas.

For the 2022-2023 program year, the Australian Government implemented a one-off increase of 30 per cent to the visa caps. The caps have now returned to the pre-existing arrangements for the 2023-2024 program year.

​The 'Status' indicators below show if applications for a first Work and Holiday visa are still open for your country of passport.

​

OPEN – Applications are open.  For Information on how to apply online see Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa.

SUSPENDED – Applications have been suspended as the cap is close to being filled or for operational reasons. You can keep checking this page to see if applications open again.

CLOSED – Applications are closed until the new program year commences on 1 July.

​​Specified work and visa conditio​​ns
Working Holiday Makers in Australia must comply with the following mandatory conditions:

condition 8547
condition 8548.
Those seeking to apply for a second or third WHM visa must also meet specified work requirements to be eligible for a further visa grant.

Visa condition 8547 (​max. 6 months work​​ with same employer)
Working Holiday Makers in Australia can work in any occupation or industry while in Australia. This is generally for up to 6 months with one employer.

Mandatory visa condition 8547 limits you to a maximum period of 6 months’ work with any one employer. If your work does not fall within an exemption to condition 8547, you will have to seek permission to work longer than 6 months for the same employer.

The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has made the decision to continue the previous exemption process relating to visa condition 8547. This began from 1 January 2024, and will continue ​while consultation on the Working Holiday program settings and reform process is underway. This is in line with the Mig​ration Strategy released on 11 December 2023.

If you have submitted a request for approval to work for longer than 6 months for the same employer, you can continue working for the same employer until you receive a written outcome of your request.

You must submit your request before the initial 6-month period lapses. If you submit your request after the initial 6-month period has lapsed, you have to stop working for the same employer and wait for the outcome of your request.

For information on exemptions to condition 8547 and to request permission to work longer than 6 months for the same employer, see 6-month-work-limitation and Applying for permissions to work longer than 6 months with one employer.

Visa cond​ition 8548​ (max. 4 months of study)
Mandatory visa condition 8548 limits you to a maximum period of 4 months study or training during your stay in Australia. The purpose of the condition is to ensure study or training on Working Holiday Maker (WHM) visas is incidental. Study should not be the primary intention or purpose for stay, unlike a student visa.

Condition 8548 applies to both subclasses 417 and 462, if you applied on or after 1 July 2006. Condition 8548 applies to all kinds of study undertaken on a full or part time basis.

The study and training limitation applies to each visa. If we grant you a second or third subclass 417 or subclass 462 visa, you will be able to undertake study or training for up to 4 months on each visa.

Correspondence courses, which you may otherwise have undertaken outside Australia, are not subject to condition 8548. You may undertake such courses with no limit on the period of study. Workplace based training is not considered to be study or training under condition 8548. The WHM program considers workplace based training to be employment.

Specified work arrangements​​​
The Department is temporarily applying flexibility to the specified work requirement. This will give greater weight to the specified work industry. It supports the Government's continued initiatives to address the current labour shortages in Australia. This means that work which supports the ongoing operations of a specified industry in an eligible postcode may be accepted.

All workers in Australia have the same rights and protections at work. This is regardless of citizenship or visa status.

You can also choose to undertake specified work to become eligible for a second or third Working Holiday (subclass 417) visa or Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa.

For more information on specified work arrangements, see:

Specified subclass 417 work
Specified subclass 462 work​​
Visa condition 8547 applies to anyone in Australia who holds any kind of WHM visa, regardless of when they arrive. It also applies to anyone who holds a Bridging visa with condition 8547 imposed and engages in any type of work (full time or part time, paid or voluntary). This applies unless you fall within one of the exemptions below.

See Exemptions to condition 8547, Requesting permission and Bridging visa holders below.

Exemptions to condition 8547
From 1 January 2024 you can work for the same employer in Australia for more than 6 months without asking permission if you work in any of the following:

different locations for the same employer, as long as work in any one location does not exceed 6 months
plant and animal cultivation anywhere in Australia
natural disaster recovery work anywhere in Australia
critical sectors, including agriculture, food processing, health, aged and disability care and childcare, tourism and hospitality, anywhere in Australia
certain industries, including, fishing and pearling, tree farming and felling, construction and mining, in northern Australia only (see Work in certain industries in northern Australia only​ below).
This applies until the Government makes further decisions.

​​Work in different locations
You do not need to ask our permission to work with the same employer for more than 6 months if you work in different locations, including working from home. Work in any one location must not exceed six months.

For example, you can work for:

If your work does not fall within one of the exemptions above, you can only work for the same employer for a maximum of 6 months while holding your WHM visa.

In some limited circumstances, you may be able to obtain permission to work longer than 6 months for the same employer. For more information, see Requesting permission below.

Requesting permission
Grounds for approving requests
If you submit a request for permission to work longer than 6 months for the same employer, we may give you permission if you:

applied for visa allowing ongoing full time work and are awaiting the outcome of your application, or
undertake work that is critical to your employer, and have attached a supporting letter from your employer to your request.
How to seek permission
If you meet any of the grounds outlined above, you can seek our approval by submitting the online form Permission to work longer than 6 months.

Period covered by the exemption or permission to work longer than 6 months
The permission will cover the remaining period of stay on your WHM visa if:

you are exempt from this condition or
we give you permission to work for more than 6 months with the same employer.
The 6-month period starts again with the grant of a new WHM visa or when a Bridging visa with condition 8547 attached to it comes into effect.

If you have already submitted a request for permission to work longer than 6 months
If you have already submitted a request for approval to work for longer than 6 months for the same employer, you can continue working for the same employer until you receive a written outcome of your request. Due to the high volume of requests, the department is not able to provide individual confirmation that we have received your request. If you are still waiting to receive a written outcome for your request, and your employer has queries, you can refer them to this web page for confirmation you can continue working for them until a decision is made.

If you submit your request for approval to work longer than six months with the same employer after the six months have already elapsed, you will need to stop work and await the outcome of your​ request.

Meaning of ‘one employer’
The 'employer' is the business or organisation that you are directly working for.

If any agency or labour supplier refers you to a business, you can work for six months for that business. The same agency or labour supplier can refer you to another business where you can work for another six months. You cannot stay in the same position in the same location with one employer for more than six months by using different:

employment agencies
business affiliates or
sub-contracting arrangements.
We consider workplace-based training work. You are able to undertake workplace-based training with the same employer for up to six months.

Self-employment
If you are self-employed, your employer for the purposes of condition 8547 is the end user. You must not provide services to the same end user (considered your sole employer) for longer than 6 months. This applies unless your work falls within one of the exemptions, or you have obtained written approval from us.

If the end user is not your sole employer, you may provide services to the end user and others for longer than 6 months without breaching condition 8547. For example, a provider of in-home services with multiple clients, or a grower supplying more than one retailer.

Calculating 6 months
The 6 months starts from the day you start work. It includes full-time, part-time, casual, shift and voluntary work. It is based on the time that has passed since you started working, not how many hours or days you have worked.

The condition applies separately to each visa, including bridging visas. This means that the 6 month period starts again when you are granted a new WHM visa and/or when a bridging visa comes into effect while you are waiting for your application to be processed.

Bridging visa holders
If you hold a Bridging visa with condition 8547 attached to it and you wish to work longer than 6 months for the same employer while your Bridging visa is in effect, you will need to apply for a new Bridging visa A to remove the condition.

We may remove condition 8547 from your new Bridging visa A if we are satisfied that you have a compelling need to work.

​Overview
To be eligible to apply for a second or third Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa, you must have already completed a prescribed minimum period of 'specified subclass 462 work' in certain circumstances.

Specified work is work that is undertaken in a 'specified' industry and in a specified area of Australia. Information on eligible industries and areas of Australia is provided below.

All specified subclass 462 work must be paid in accordance with the relevant Australian legislation and awards.

You can include voluntary work as specified work for the purpose of applying for a second or third Work and Holiday visa where it is related to recovery work undertaken in bushfire declared areas or other areas that have been declared affected by other natural disasters.

Approved industries and areas for specified work
The following industries and areas are approved for specified work:

tourism and hospitality in northern or remote and very remote Australia
plant and animal cultivation in northern Australia and other specified areas of regional Australia
fishing and pearling in northern Australia only
tree farming and felling in northern Australia only
construction in northern Australia and other specified areas of regional Australia
bushfire recovery work in declared bushfire affected areas carried out after 31 July 2019
recovery work in natural disaster affected areas carried out after 31 December 2021
critical COVID-19 work in the healthcare and medical sectors anywhere in Australia, after 31 January 2020.
In support of the Government's continuing initiatives to address the current labour shortages in Australia, the Department is temporarily applying flexibility to the specified work requirement. This gives greater weight to the specified work industry. This means that work which supports the ongoing operations of a specified industry in an eligible postcode may be accepted.

Tourism and hospitality in northern or remote and very remote Australia only
Tourism and hospitality work carried out from 22 June 2021 in northern or remote and very remote Australia will be considered eligible specified work for the purpose of a second or third Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa application lodged from 5 March 2022.

Work in a range of occupations that directly provide a service to tourists, including:

tourist guides and operators

How to count specified work
This section applies equally to both Working Holiday (subclass 417) and Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visas and uses the collective term 'Working Holiday Maker' (WHM) visas.

Minimum period
To be eligible for a second WHM visa, you must have carried out at least 3 months of specified work. ‘3 months’ is taken to mean a period equivalent to the 3 shortest 'calendar' months of the year, that is, a minimum period of 88 calendar days, including weekends or equivalent rest days during your period of employment.

To be eligible for a third WHM visa, you must have carried out at least 6 months of specified work on or after 1 July 2019. '6 months' is taken to mean a period equivalent to the 6 shortest 'calendar' months of the year, that is, a minimum period of 179 calendar days, including weekends or equivalent rest days during your period of employment.

To meet the requirement for a minimum period of specified work you must complete the same number of normal work days or shifts as a full-time employee in that role and industry would normally work in a 3 month (88 calendar day) or 6 month (179 calendar day) period. You can do this in a variety of ways, for example:

working 5 days a week for a continuous period of 3 or 6 calendar months, including on a piecework rate agreement
working less than 5 days a week over a period longer than 3 or 6 calendar months, including on a piecework rate agreement
working multiple short periods of work in any combination of full time, part time or on a piecework rate, which add up to the equivalent of 5 days a week over 3 or 6 calendar months
You do not need to do your 3 or 6 months of specified work all in one go, or all with one employer. You are free to spread the work over the stay period of your current visa. You can also undertake specified work for longer than the required minimum period.

You cannot complete the specified work requirement in a total period shorter than 3 or 6 calendar months.

Example - Marko - full time continuous work

While on his first visa, Marko works full-time for a tour company as a tour guide from 1 December to 26 February, a total of 88 calendar days. Marko works 5 days a week (Monday to Friday) for this whole period of time and is paid the correct legal wage.  Marko has met the 3 month specified work requirement.

Example – Kim – does not meet 3 months of specified work

While on her first visa, Kim works 2 days a week at a vineyard maintaining vines and picking grapes from 1 February to 30 April. The vineyard work is eligible specified work and she is paid the correct lawful wage. The work has occurred over a 3 month period; however, she has not worked the equivalent number of days that would be worked by a full time worker in a 3 month period. She will need to work a proportionately longer period of part time work to meet the specified work requirement.

Kim has not worked the equivalent of 3 months’ specified work and does not meet the requirement

Example - Karla - separate periods of full time and part time work:

First job – While on her second visa, Karla works 5 days a week in a fruit orchard picking and packing fruit under a signed piecework rate agreement from 1 January to 30 April. This period counts as 4 calendar months (in this case 120 calendar days) towards the specified work requirement.

Second job - Later, Karla does casual work picking vegetables at a market garden for 5 days a fortnight from 1 August to 30 November. During this period of 4 calendar months (in this case 122 calendar days) she has worked half of the usual full time work hours for this employer. This period can therefore count as a total of 2 months (or 61 days) towards the specified work requirement.

Karla adds these 2 work periods together, counting:
4 months (120 calendar days) for the period of full time work
+
2 months (61 calendar days) for the period of part time work over 4 months
=
6 months (which in in this case is more than 179 calendar days) of specified work

Karla has therefore worked the equivalent of 6 months of full time work and has met the 6 month specified work requirement.

Circumstances in which specified work must have been undertaken
As a general rule, you must have undertaken all your specified work while holding your previous WHM visa. This means that applicants for a second WHM visa must have undertaken all specified work while holding their first WHM visa, and applicants for a third WHM visa must have undertaken all specified work while holding their second WHM visa, on or after 1 July 2019. This is how most applicants meet the specified work requirement.

A small number of applicants may also be able to count specified work carried out in the circumstances described below.

Bridging visas
This rule ensures that, in certain circumstances, specified work you undertake while waiting for your visa application to be processed can still be counted towards a subsequent WHM visa application.

If:

you applied for a second WHM visa while your first WHM visa was still valid, and
while we were still processing your second WHM visa application, your first WHM visa ceased and a bridging visa came into effect
then you can count specified work carried out on this bridging visa towards eligibility for a third WHM visa, whether you apply in or outside Australia.

Subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visas
For applications lodged on or after 14 November 2020, former WHMs can count critical COVID-19 work in the healthcare and medical sectors undertaken on a subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visa towards eligibility for a second or third WHM visa. This special arrangement recognises the contribution of WHMs doing critical COVID-19 work in the healthcare and medical sectors and ensures they can still access subsequent WHM visa options.

If you:

transitioned in Australia from a WHM visa directly to a subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visa (or an unbroken series of subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visas), and
carried out some critical COVID-19 work in the healthcare and medical sectors while holding one of these subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visas
Then you can count:

that work, and
any other specified work you carried out while holding a subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visa
towards eligibility for a second or third WHM visa, whether you apply in or outside Australia.

And the previous bridging visas rule also applies if you held, or applied for, a subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visa.

For the avoidance of doubt, the following work can’t be counted as specified work:

work undertaken while you held a subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visa if you did NOT carry out any critical COVID-19 work in the healthcare and medical sectors
work undertaken while you held any other kind of visa, for example a Student visa
work undertaken while you held a subclass 408 visa that was not in the “AGEE COVID-19 Pandemic event” stream
work undertaken while you held a bridging visa other than in the circumstances described above
for third WHM visa applications, work undertaken while you held your first WHM visa
for third WHM visa applications, work undertaken before 1 July 2019
Example – Dara – specified work while on a bridging visa is eligible
While Dara was in Australia on her first Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa, she applied for a second Work and Holiday visa. During the processing of her application, her first Work and Holiday visa expired, her bridging visa came into effect and she commenced specified work. Her second Work and Holiday visa was then granted.

The specified work Dara undertook after her first Work and Holiday visa expired and while she held the bridging visa is eligible.

Example – Jiri – specified work while on a bridging visa is not eligible

Jiri left Australia when his first Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa expired and returned to Australia on a student visa.  At the completion of his studies, he applied in Australia for a second Work and Holiday visa.  After submitting his application, he commenced specified work.  During the processing of his application, Jiri’s student visa expired and his bridging visa came into effect. His second Work and Holiday visa was then granted and he continued his specified work.

The specified work Jiri undertook after he submitted his application and before his second Work and Holiday visa was granted (that is, while his student visa was still valid or while he held the bridging visa) is not eligible. (However, specified work undertaken after the grant of his second Work and Holiday visa will be eligible.)

Example – Bernadette – critical COVID-19 work in the healthcare and medical sectors on a subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visa is eligible

During Bernadette’s first WHM visa, the COVID-19 pandemic was declared and she decided to work as a contact tracer in Melbourne rather than relocate to a regional area to do specified work. This meant that she was not eligible to apply for a second WHM visa, but was also unable to depart Australia due to travel restrictions when her first WHM visa expired. On the basis of her critical work, she was granted a subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visa. She then continued to work as a contact tracer for 3 months. If she chooses to apply for a second WHM visa in the future, she will meet the specified work requirement.

Example – Sam – critical COVID-19 work in the healthcare and medical sectors and other specified work on a subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visa is eligible

One month before Sam’s second WHM visa expired, he started working as a nurse in a COVID-19 testing centre. He was then granted a subclass 408 COVID-19 Pandemic event visa and continued his critical COVID-19 work in the healthcare and medical sectors for 4 months, until the testing centre closed.  He then worked for one month picking fruit in regional Australia.  If Sam chooses to apply for a third WHM visa in the future, he will be able to count all this work to meet the 6 month specified work requirement.

Normal work days or shifts
You should agree with your employer the number of working hours, before you start work.

One single day of work is considered to be the normal number of hours per day or shift that is considered standard practice in the industry and role in which you are employed.

If you are working on a piecework rate the number of hours can depend on the weather and ripening of crops.

If you are working on an Award you should check your conditions of employment, including rostering, overtime, and penalty rates.

You cannot count work carried out on any one calendar day as more than one day of specified subclass 462 work. For example, if the industry's standard day is 5 hours long, working 10 hours on one day–in a single or separate shifts for one or more employers – does not count as 2 days of specified work.

For volunteer bushfire or flood recovery work, any day on which you worked can be counted as one day.

Example: While on her second visa, Maria works on a dairy farm milking and other duties. Maria makes an agreement with her employer to work 5 days a week (Monday to Friday) from 4am to 7am and 1pm to 4pm each working day (a total of 6 working hours per day) for 6 months. These hours are considered normal for this role and Maria is paid the correct legal wage. Maria can count every day of work towards the 6 month specified work requirement, which she meets.

Example: While on his first visa, Jose works on a fruit orchard picking and packing mangoes. Jose is working on a piecework rate and works 5 or 6 days a week for 3 months. Depending on the weather and ripening of crops he works between 5 to eight hours each working day. Jose can count all of these days of work towards the 3 month specified work requirement, which he meets.

Example: While on her first visa, Sophia works on a casual basis for a café. Sophia works 5 or 6 days a week for 3 months. Depending on the café roster Sophia works between 5 to nine hours each working day (including meal breaks). These hours are considered normal in this industry and role and she has been paid the correct legal wage. Sophia has met the 3 month specified work requirement.

Example: While on his first visa, Luigi works as a nurse at a hospital caring for COVID-19 patients and conducting COVID-19 screening. Luigi works 3 12-hour shifts per week for 3 months. As these hours are considered normal in this industry, Luigi has met the 3 month specified work requirement.

Australian public holidays and sick days
Australian public holidays and sick days (or equivalent workers compensation leave days) can be counted as a day of specified work if you are paid for that day. Public Holiday or leave days which are not paid cannot be included in your total period of specified work.

If you are working on an Award you should check your conditions of employment including leave and public holiday entitlements.

Severe or seasonal weather
You cannot include any unpaid days where you did not work due to severe or seasonal weather towards your total period of specified work.

You should plan to complete your specified work early in your stay, as no exception will be made for failure to complete the required minimum period of specified work because of severe weather–or any other reason.

Example: While on her first visa, Petra was contracted to work 5 days a week under a piecework rate agreement on a sugar-cane farm doing harvest work from 1 June to 27 August – a period of 88 calendar days. However, she could not work for a total of 5 scheduled working days due to severe weather, and she was not paid for these 5 days. Petra later completed an additional 5 working days with another employer from 1 to 5 September, also under a piecework rate agreement. She has now completed the equivalent of 3 months (88 calendar days) of full time work and has met the 3 month specified work requirement.

Shift work
Variable shift work arrangements which are standard practice in the industry can be counted towards specified work.

For example, if your full time paid employment contract involves 2 weeks rostered on for every day and then 2 weeks rostered off as rest days, provided this is standard practice in the industry, and you are paid for this whole period, then all 4 weeks (28 days) can be counted towards your total period of specified work. Be sure to keep a copy of your employment contract.

How to find specified work
You can find specified work vacancies in the same way you would find other job vacancies, such as through employment pages in newspapers, the internet and job placement service providers. Vacancies specifically for plant and animal cultivation can be found on the Harvest Trail website.

Not all vacancies advertised on the Harvest Trail website will qualify as specified subclass 462 work, or give you eligibility for a second or third Work and Holiday visa.

You should ensure that the vacancy meets the definition of specified subclass 462 work listed above and that the work will take place in an eligible postcode of northern Australia. See the section on 'Northern Australia' below to check the postcode list of designated areas.

You should not leave it until the end of your stay to arrange your specified work, to allow for unforeseen circumstances which may prevent completion of the required period specified work, such as bad weather, illness or not finding enough work.

Remote and very remote Australia
Tourism and hospitality work carried out from 22 June 2021 in the following areas of remote and very remote Australia will be considered eligible specified work for the purpose of a second or third Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa application lodged from 5 March 2022.

​Working holidays for Australians
For Australian citizens, the Working Holiday Maker program offers the opportunity to travel and work overseas in over 40 different countries or jurisdictions.  Australian participants can generally stay for up to 12 months and undertake short-term work and study.
