Inspired by https://blog.streamlit.io/langchain-tutorial-4-build-an-ask-the-doc-app/, I built a LLM-based Q&A App for Indonesian people to ask all-things WHV-related. The provided answers are sourced from official government websites.

## Background
### What is a Work Holiday Visa (WHV)?
A Work Holiday Visa is a temporary visa that allows young people from eligible countries to travel and work in Australia for a period of up to one year. It's designed to encourage cultural exchange and provide an opportunity for young people to experience living and working in Australia.
### Growing Interest in WHV Australia
There has been a growing interest in obtaining a Work Holiday Visa for Australia among Indonesian youth. This is evident from the increasing search trends on Google, as well as the high engagement rates on TikTok and Instagram content related to WHV Australia, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic.
The idea of exploring Australia while earning Australian dollars is highly appealing to many Indonesians. Moreover, the Australian government has been increasing the quota for Indonesian Work Holiday Visa applicants year by year, further fueling this interest.

## Problem Statement
Language Barrier and Misleading Information
One of the significant challenges faced by Indonesian applicants is the difficulty in understanding the official information provided by the Australian Department of Home Affairs (immi.gov.au) due to language barriers and the lack of English proficiency.

As a result, many Indonesians rely heavily on information shared by social media influencers and content creators. However, this information can sometimes be misleading or inaccurate, as it is not coming from professional or authoritative sources.

The lack of reliable and accessible information about the Work Holiday Visa process has led to several reported cases of scams, where individuals have lost significant amounts of money.

## Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, I propose building a Q&A interface that allows users to input questions about the Work Holiday Visa in Indonesian and receive trustworthy answers from authoritative resources (e.g. official websites from the governments).
